1. First method is to have a stop bit in the end it can be any character or symbol like 's'.

2. Second method is if you yourself entering the string to be sent and yourself receiving it then first calculate the the length of the 
   string entered by you and then run the loop for that much time. (NOTE: Counting the length is also a problem)
   Example : say length of string =6, then
                                          int count = 0;
                                          char str[len-1];
                                          while(1)
                                          {
                                           if(Serial.available())
                                           {
                                           str[count] = Serial.read();    // Store the variable in str[]array
                                           count++;                      // keep incrementing the count variable
                                           }
                                           if(count >= len)              // Monitor the count variable and when it becomes = length
                                           {                             // of the string then write a break condition
                                           
                                           count=0;                         //Make count =0;
                                           break;                           // The condition will break and will come out of while loop
                                           
                                           }
                                           
3. Third you can increment a variable as timer and for that time receive the data (Note: Many times misses the data)
   Example:   
                    int timer=0;
                    char str[20];            // Create a random size array
                    int count = 0;
                    while(!Serial.available())
                    while(timer<2000)         //the loop runs for 2000 times, so in most cases the full data sting or array is received. 
                    {
                    if(Serial.available())   //When ever data found, enter this condition
                    {
                    str[count] = Serial.read();  // store the data in str[] array
                    count++;
                    }
                    timer++;
                    }
